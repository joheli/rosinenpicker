  # List your strategies here; name strategies as you please
  my_strategy_01: 
    # processed_directory: the folder where to be processed files are looked for and hopefully found
    processed_directory: '/path/to/your_directory'
    # file_selection_pattern: a regex pattern selecting the files to be processed
    file_name_pattern: 'regex_pattern_identifying_your_file'
    # optional: file_content_pattern - a regex pattern that has to return a match in the file contents
    # this can be used to filter to be processed files in addition to file name
    #file_content_pattern: '.*'
    # file_format
    # currently only 'pdf' and 'txt' are supported
    file_format: 'pdf'
    # terms
    terms:
      # Chose names for the terms and associate each with a regex pattern or, alternatively,
      # two regex patterns surrounding '@@@', which serves as a divider.
      # In the former case (i.e. only one regex pattern, no divider) matches to the regex are returned.
      # In the latter case (i.e. divider present) the one or two regex patterns are converted
      # to groups surrounding a central "match-all" (.*) pattern. Only matches to the "match-all"-group
      # are returned.

    # optional, for csv, set export_csv_divider (defaults to ;)
